    This calculates a nominal torque value per revolution of the crankshaft considering the following: 
    <ul>
        <li>The total volume of the cylinders in each power stroke per revolution in a 4-stroke engine.</li> 
        <li>The boost in intake preassure.</li> 
        <li>An estimated average thermal efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    As a general rule of thumb, the thermal efficiency of an internal combustion engine will be proportional to its compression ratio. 
    Also, more cylinders will increase friction loss, thus reducing efficiency.

    Modern gasoline engines have a maximum thermal efficiency of about 20% to 35% when used to power a car. 
    In other words, even when the engine is operating at its point of maximum thermal efficiency, 
    of the total heat energy released by the gasoline consumed, about 65-80% of total power is emitted as heat 
    without being turned into useful work, i.e. turning the crankshaft. Approximately half of this rejected heat 
    is carried away by the exhaust gases, and half passes through the cylinder walls or cylinder head into the 
    engine cooling system, and is passed to the atmosphere via the cooling system radiator. Some of the work 
    generated is also lost as friction, noise, air turbulence, and work used to turn engine equipment and appliances 
    such as water and oil pumps and the electrical generator, leaving only about 20-35% of the energy released by 
    the fuel consumed available to move the vehicle.
